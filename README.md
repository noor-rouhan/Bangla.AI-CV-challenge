# Computer Vision Challange on Bengali Handwritten Digit Recognition by Bengali.AI.

First ever machine learning contest held in kaggle in Bangladesh by a open source community namely Bengali.AI dedidcated to research and developemnt on Bengali language and processing. 

## NumtaDB

Brand new dataset for Bangla Digit recognition has been developed consist of 85000+ specimens.

## Dataset Overview
In this competition weâ€™ve trained our model with recently developed large dataset NumtaDB consists of 85000+ data and trained with 72040 specimens from the dataset initially. Rest of the specimens and additional 4000+ highly augmented, noisy specimens totaling 17760 specimens used as test dataset in the competition. The test dataset has some very challenging test cases to evaluate model performance in worst scenario.
